# Project Overview

This is a simple, static personal website for Juan Herrera. It is a single HTML file with inline CSS. The website showcases Juan's professional background, projects, blog posts, and contact information.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main and only page of the website.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions. The code is self-contained in a single HTML file.
