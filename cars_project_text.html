								<H3>Story</H3>
								<p>
									I graduated from college in May 2022, and just three weeks later I moved to Houston to get settled in before starting my new job. I didn't have a car when I first moved to Houston 
									and I decided to give it a try and see how life was without a car there. It took me about a day to realize that I absolutely needed a car...

									<br>
									I went to two dealerships to ask about prices of used cars and quickly realized that prices were really high! I was quite suprised to see how expensive used cars were. So I decided that I 
									needed to narrow down my list of options and look only for cars that I knew I could afford. This is when I decided to introduce a bit of Data Science and Machine Learning to this issue.
								</p>


								<h3>Solution</h3>


								<p>
									
									I scraped used cars for sale in Craiglist and compiled a dataset of over 400k cars including many features about each one of them. Then,
									I created a Machine Learning model where my main interest was to understand the variables influencing the price of the car, and more importantly I wanted to play with the different features and obtain 
									a close price estimate of the car. This project allowed me to narrow down my list of potential cars to buy to only a couple of cars, and <b>my search became a lot more targeted and less time consuming</b>.

									<br><br>

								</p>



								<h3>Technical Aspects</h3>

								<p>
									This was the first time that a machine learning model I created made it out of my Jupyter Notebook in my local machine, huge success! I created an <a href="https://juanherrera-car-app.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">app</a> using Streamlit and 
									I was able to use the model that I trained in this app, which is now up and running.
